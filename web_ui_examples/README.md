# Web UI Examples
This folder contains walk-through examples (with screenshots) of how to use the online [Citrination UI](https://citrination.com/).   

After you've explored the web UI, we encourage you to also check out the Citrination application program interface (API) which allows you to interact with your data and models through Python scripts (examples/tutorials [here](../api_examples/) and [here](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination)).
