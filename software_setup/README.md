# Software setup
The files in this folder specify most of the required Python packages for working with Citrination tutorials and provide some tests in a Jupyter notebook to make sure the software is installed correctly.

To install all the Python packages required to run the code in this repo, download the [requirements file](requirements.txt) and then type the following command into the command line:
```
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
