# API Examples
This folder contains examples (Jupyter notebooks) of how to interface with the [Python Citrination Client](http://citrineinformatics.github.io/python-citrination-client/index.html). You should make sure that you have Python 3 and relevant packages installed using the `requirements.txt` file in the main folder.

## Additional resources
* More API examples can be found in our public [learn-citrination](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination) GitHub repo. In particular, the following tools are not described in this repo:
  * `pypif` tutorials: [Intro](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/WorkingWithPIFs.ipynb) and [Advanced](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/AdvancedPif.ipynb) notebooks describing the PIF structure and how to use the `pypif` package.
  * `SearchClient` tutorials: [Intro](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/IntroQueries.ipynb) and [Advanced](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/AdvancedQueries.ipynb) notebooks explaining how queries are constructed to search for data using the API.
* Screenshot tutorials of our web UI can be found in a [separate folder](../web_ui_examples).
