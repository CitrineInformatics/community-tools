    "In this notebook, we will cover how to *create* a data view using the [Citrination API](http://citrineinformatics.github.io/python-citrination-client/). Data views provide the configuration necessary in order to perform machine learning and identify relationships in your data. Previously, data views could only be created using the online user interface, but now they can be created using Python and API calls as well. We will demonstrate this functionality using the [Band gaps from Strehlow and Cook](https://citrination.com/datasets/1160/show_search?searchMatchOption=fuzzyMatch) dataset, where we will create a view mapping: \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "To recap, this notebook went through the steps for creating a data view using the API.\n",
    "1. First, we used the DataViewBuilder object to specify the configuration.\n",
    "2. Then, we trained the model, which is simple as long as the configuration is correct.\n",
    "3. Lastly, we explored some of the post-processing capabilities, such as retraining and submitting predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional resources\n",
    "It's now possible to conduct the major aspects of the Citrination workflow through the API, which should increase the speed and flexibility of informatics approaches. Some other topics that might interest you include:\n",
    "* More details regarding client functions in the [code base](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/python-citrination-client/blob/develop/citrination_client/views/client.py).\n",
    "* [DataClient](http://citrineinformatics.github.io/python-citrination-client/tutorial/data_examples.html) - This allows you to create datasets and upload PIF data (only) using the API.\n",
    "  * There is also a corresponding [tutorial](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/community-tools/blob/master/api_examples/data_client_api_tutorial.ipynb).\n",
    "* [SearchClient](http://citrineinformatics.github.io/python-citrination-client/tutorial/search_examples.html) - This gives you a flexible and fast way to access PIF data on Citrination.\n",
    "  * In particular, take a look at our [Intro](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/IntroQueries.ipynb) and [Advanced](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/AdvancedQueries.ipynb) tutorials for how to construct queries.\n",
