We will demonstrate how analyze ML models and leverage them for prediction and design using the [Band gaps from Strehlow and Cook](https://citrination.com/datasets/1160/show_search?searchMatchOption=fuzzyMatch) dataset, where we will have created a model mapping:\n",

    "## t-SNE\n",
    "t-SNE is short for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. This technique was developed about [a decade ago](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) ([simpler explanation](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/t-sne-implementation-r-python/)) and it's a powerful projection tool because nearby points in high dimensional space remain close in 2D while distant points remain far apart. Therefore, t-SNE plots are helpful for identifying clusters and structures in your data. We employ t-SNE as a *dimensionality reduction* technique to project the data onto 2 dimensions for ease of visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Tsne` object contains many `Projection` objects (one for each output `Property`) with the following properties:\n",
    "* `xs`: A list of $x$ values of the projection.\n",
    "* `ys`: A list of $y$ values of the projection.\n",
    "* `responses`: A list of $z$ (Property) values of the projection.\n",
    "* `tags`: A list of tags for the projected points.\n",
    "* `uids`: A list of record UIDs for the projected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create the t-SNE plot from the coordinates and values. Further analysis with t-SNE is performed in [this other demo](https://github.com/CitrineInformatics/learn-citrination/blob/master/tsneDemo.ipynb)."
