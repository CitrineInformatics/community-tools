Data views provide the configuration necessary in order to perform machine learning and identify relationships in your data. We will demonstrate this functionality using the [Band gaps from Strehlow and Cook](https://citrination.com/datasets/1160/show_search?searchMatchOption=fuzzyMatch) dataset, where we will create a view mapping: \n",
