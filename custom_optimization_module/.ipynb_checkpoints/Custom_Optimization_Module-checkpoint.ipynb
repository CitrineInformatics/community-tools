    "# Outline\n",
    "The following notebook illustrates how to use the python Citrination client (PyCC) to implement a third-party optimization strategy. In this example we were working with a University's high throughput material synthesis capability. The goal of their research was to find new sets of reactor parameters that would ultimately lead to new stable materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example,\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say your interested in seeing if combinations of conductive polymer synthetic parameters outside of the norm lead to a higher conductivity sample. You might have control over the following,\n",

    "\n",
    "We could then train a machine learning model on this data, which could serve as a function relating our inputs to our desired outputs. With Citrination each prediction is also supplied with a loss or uncertainty. In this case, we are interested in maximizing the uncertainty in our target property and since the predicted loss is always positive, minimizing the opposite of the uncertainty in the prediction provides a maximization strategy. If we then use a minimization method upon our function we could rapidly generate sets of inputs for unexplored regions of synthesis parameter space This could ultimately lead to a new paradigm for a high performing material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Approach\n",
    "For the University collaborator the goal was to carryout a [maximum uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07423) (MU) optimization strategy. In MU the goal is to find candidates with the highest uncertainty, leading to a very exploratory traversal of design space. To achieve this we will need the users model (a data view in the vernacular of Citrination), the boundary conditions of the design space, and a minimization function from the [SciPy optimize library.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) Finally, we will need to define an acquisition function to be optimized.\n",

When working with the SciPy optimize library this function will need to accept parameters in the form of a nd.array and return a single float.

For example, consider attempting predict Young's Modulus of a block co-polymer from block length and annealing temperature. f<sub>acq</sub> would be the resulting machine learning model that Citrination generates, which would map your inputs: Condition block length, Condition annealing temperature to your output, Property Young's Modulus. The formatting and interconversion logic between occurs in the `material_from_vector` function. It should also be noted, that SciPy optimize focuses on minimization. In the case of maximization, we must take the negative of `func` value.\n",
