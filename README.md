## Python package installation
The Python code in this repo works best with Python 3, which you should have [installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your local machine. [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is another option that works well.

To install all the Python packages required to run the code in this repo, download the [requirements file](software_setup/requirements.txt) and then type the following command into the command line:
```
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
